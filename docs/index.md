# Welcome to the Documentation for NOMAD base sections at HZB

## Introduction

This is a NOMAD plugin. For information on how to use plugins, see [NOMAD Plugins](https://nomad-lab/prod/v1/staging/docs/plugins.html).

## Citations

If you use this plugin in your research, please see our [citation guidelines](citation.md). Proper citation helps us track the impact of our work and secure continued support for development.

## About the Plugin

The core of this plugin includes deposition techniques used in perovskite solar cells, characterization methods for these solar cells, and electrochemical techniques, such as those involving a potentiostat. The plugin offers a structured approach to managing and analyzing data related to these techniques, facilitating a deeper understanding and innovations in solar cell and electrocatalysis research.

## Baseclasses Folder

The `baseclasses` folder is the heart of this plugin, containing several NOMAD schemas developed at Helmoltz-Zentrum Berlin (HZB). These schemas are critical for organizing and interpreting experimental data.

## Application Plugins and Parsers

The schemas and techniques provided by this plugin can be used to derive application-specific plugins and parsers. Here are some examples of how our baseclasses have been utilized in different contexts:

- [HZB Solar Cells](https://github.com/nomad-hzb/nomad-hysprint)
- [HZB Electro Catalysis](https://github.com/nomad-hzb/nomad-chemical-energy)
- [KIT Solar Cells](https://github.com/nomad-hzb/nomad-perotf)
