# NOMAD HZB base classes Plugin

## What is this Plugin?

This plugin provides a comprehensive set of base schemas for the digital representation of synthesis and characterization techniques in materials science. Developed at Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin (HZB), it serves as a foundation for the NOMAD ecosystem, enabling standardized, interoperable, and extensible data management for a wide range of experimental workflows.

## Key Features

- **Broad Coverage:** Includes schemas for synthesis, processing, and characterization of materials, with a focus on photovoltaics and heterogeneous catalysis.
- **Specializations:** Offers detailed models for perovskite solar cell research, electrochemical energy conversion, and catalytic processes.
- **Extensibility:** Designed to be extended for new techniques and custom workflows in further plugins extending and specializing these classes further.

## Main Schema Areas


### Synthesis & Processing

The plugin provides a rich set of schemas to capture the full complexity of modern materials synthesis, supporting both traditional and advanced methods:

- **Wet Chemical Deposition:**

    - Covers solution-based techniques such as spin coating, dip coating, drop casting, inkjet printing, and doctor blading.
    - Includes detailed tracking of precursor solutions, concentrations, solvents, additives, and process parameters (e.g., temperature, humidity, atmosphere).
    - Supports multi-step protocols for layer-by-layer fabrication, post-deposition treatments (e.g., annealing, washing), and combinatorial approaches.
    - Enables documentation of substrate cleaning, surface functionalization, and interface engineering steps.

- **Vapour-Based Deposition:**

    - Models for physical vapor deposition (PVD), chemical vapor deposition (CVD), atomic layer deposition (ALD), and related techniques.
    - Captures source materials, gas flows, chamber conditions, substrate preparation, and in-situ monitoring.
    - Enables documentation of complex multi-source and multi-step processes, essential for advanced thin-film and nanostructure fabrication.
    - Supports hybrid and sequential deposition strategies, such as co-evaporation and pulsed laser deposition.

- **Solution Manufacturing:**

    - Schemas for the preparation, mixing, and storage of chemical solutions used in synthesis.
    - Tracks batch information, purity, and handling protocols to ensure reproducibility and traceability.
    - Supports documentation of precursor aging, filtration, and quality control procedures.

- **Material Processes Miscellaneous:**

    - Additional protocols for specialized or emerging synthesis methods not covered by standard categories.
    - Flexible schema design allows for rapid adaptation to new experimental workflows, including combinatorial and high-throughput synthesis.

- **Atmosphere and Environmental Control:**

    - Detailed models for controlled-atmosphere synthesis, including glovebox operations, inert gas handling, and environmental monitoring.
    - Enables tracking of environmental parameters throughout the synthesis process for reproducibility and data integrity.

These synthesis schemas are designed to interoperate with characterization and assay schemas, enabling seamless tracking of a materialâ€™s full experimental history from initial preparation to final measurement.

## How to Use

These schemas are intended as building blocks for labs specific plugins and parsers. They can be extended and specialized a new lab specific needs. They are already used by several groups in NOMAD plugins, such as:

- [HZB Solar Cells](https://github.com/nomad-hzb/nomad-hysprint)
- [HZB Electro Catalysis](https://github.com/nomad-hzb/nomad-chemical-energy)
- [KIT Solar Cells](https://github.com/nomad-hzb/nomad-perotf)
