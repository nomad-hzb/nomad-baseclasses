# Spreadsheet Workflow - Documenting Solar Cell Synthesis and Measurements at HZB

This guide explains how to document your solar cells synthesis at HZB using our standard workflow. This process involves using a spreadsheet to record synthesis details and then uploading the sheet along with your measurement files to the NOMAD data management platform.

## Why do we need this workflow?

Documenting your experiments in a structured way is crucial for several reasons:

- **Reproducibility**: It allows you and others to understand and reproduce your experiments in the future.

- **Data Quality**: It ensures that your data is well-organized and properly described, making it more valuable.

- **Data Sharing**: It enables you to easily share your data with colleagues and the wider scientific community.

- **NOMAD Integration**: It ensures that your data can be seamlessly integrated into the NOMAD database, making it accessible and searchable for future research.

## The Spreadsheet Workflow

The workflow consists of the following steps:

1. **Planning the Experiment**

2. **Requesting the Spreadsheet**

    Once you have a plan, you'll need the correct spreadsheet template.

    **Contact the data stewards**: They will provide you with the appropriate spreadsheet template for your specific experiment.
    
    **Specify your needs**: When requesting the sheet, provide them with the necessary details about your experiment (see TODO ) so they can provide the correct template.

3. **Filling in the Spreadsheet**

4. **Getting NOMAD IDs**

    NOMAD IDs are unique identifiers that link your measurement files to the specific samples you created in your experiment.

    Why are these needed?: These IDs are crucial for connecting your raw data to the experimental metadata in the NOMAD database.  This connection is essential for better data management, searchability, and analysis.

5. **Uploading to NOMAD**

    The final step is to upload your completed Excel sheet and your measurement files to the NOMAD platform.

    **Prepare your files**: Ensure your measurement files are named according to the standard syntax explained in TODO.  

    **Verify the upload**: Check that there was no error in the upload.
