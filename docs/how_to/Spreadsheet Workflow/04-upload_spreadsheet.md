# Uploading Your Spreadsheet to NOMAD

You've now completed the process of planning your synthesis experiment, obtaining and filling the spreadsheet, and performing the experiment. After updating the spreadsheet to reflect any deviations or changes that occurred during the synthesis, you're ready to upload it to NOMAD.

Here's how to upload your Excel sheet and what to expect:

## Upload Process

1. **Name Your Spreadsheet File:** Give your spreadsheet file a descriptive and meaningful name. This will help you and others easily identify the experiment it documents (e.g., `20240728_Perovskite_Synthesis_Batch_XYZ.xlsx`).

2. **Create a NOMAD Upload:** In the NOMAD platform, create a new upload for your experiment.

3. **Upload the Spreadsheet File:** Upload your named spreadsheet file to the newly created upload in NOMAD.

4. **NOMAD Processing:** NOMAD will automatically process the spreadsheet file, recognize its format, and create the necessary entries in the database. These entries will represent your samples, the synthesis processes, and their associated parameters.

5. **Verify Successful Upload:** After the upload is complete, your upload will be populated with entries.

    * **Successful Upload:** The empty upload will be populated with entries associated with the processes and samples.

        * \[TODO: Insert picture of successful entries created\]

    * **File Not Recognized:** If the spreadsheet file is not recognized, no entries will be created. The spreadsheet file will be present in the upload, but no other entries will be generated.

        * \[TODO: Insert picture of directory exploration showing only the file and no entries\]

    * **Failed Entry Creation:** In some cases, NOMAD may recognize the file but encounter errors during the creation of entries. This will result in a failed upload.

        * \[TODO: Insert picture of failed processed entry\]

## Troubleshooting Upload Issues

If you encounter issues during the upload process, here are some steps you can take:

* **Pre-Upload Checklist/Troubleshooting Guide:** Consult the pre-upload checklist and troubleshooting guide for common problems and solutions. \[TODO: Link to the guide\]

* **Contact Data Stewards:** If you are unable to resolve the issue yourself, please contact the data stewards for assistance.

## Important Upload Settings

When creating a NOMAD upload, ensure the following settings are applied:

  * **Add Group Members:** Add the group you belong to as members of the upload.

  * **Add Data Stewards as Co-authors:** Add the data stewards as co-authors to the upload.

These settings ensure that the data stewards have the necessary access to assist you with any issues and to properly manage the data.
