# Filling Your Excel Sheet

The Excel sheet provided for documenting your synthesis experiment is structured to ensure comprehensive and organized data capture. Here's a breakdown of its pre-filled elements and instructions for completing it accurately.

## Pre-filled Elements

The Excel sheet includes the following pre-filled elements to streamline your documentation process:

* **Two-Level Header:**

  * The first row provides a high-level organization, containing merged cells that represent:

    * "Experiment Info": This section captures general metadata about the overall experiment and includes the NOMAD ID column.

    * Process Columns: Each subsequent merged cell represents a specific synthesis process (e.g., "1: Cleaning O2-Plasma", "2: Spin Coating").

  * The second row specifies the parameters to be documented for each section or process.

* **NOMAD ID Column**: This column automatically generates unique identifiers (NOMAD IDs) for each sample and is located within the "Experiment Info" section. These IDs are essential for linking your measurement files to the corresponding synthesis data within the NOMAD database.

## Instructions for Completing the Sheet

Follow these guidelines to ensure your Excel sheet is filled correctly:

* **One Row Per Sample:** Each row in the Excel sheet should represent a single sample.

* **Efficient Data Entry:** Utilize Excel's "select and drop" feature to efficiently populate repetitive parameters across multiple samples.

* **Process Validity:** A deposition process is considered valid only if the "Material Name" column for that process is populated. If no material name is provided, any other information entered for that process in that row will be disregarded.

* **Material Name Specificity:** When filling the material name for the **absorber layer**, use the **cationic formula** with elemental symbols and stoichiometry (e.g., "Cs 0.055 MA 0.047 FA 0.898 Pb I 2.906 Br 0.141"), not abbreviations.

* **Measurement Units:**

  * If a measurement unit is indicated in the parameter name, enter only the numerical value of the data.

  * If you need to record a parameter using a different unit, consult the list of accepted measurement units and replace it in the column, using the exact syntax provided TODO here.

  * If your desired unit is not in the accepted list, please inform the data stewards.
